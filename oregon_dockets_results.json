By coupling the energy storage system with PW2\u2019s \nreciprocating engines the combined resource beco mes enabled to qualify as contingency reserve, \neven while the engi ne is not running. \nThe project design work was completed in N ovember 2020 and the ba ttery energy storage \nequipment was delivered to the site in Decembe r 2020. Construction and controls integration work \ncommenced and continued through  August of 2021. The battery was energized and the system \ntesting and commissioning were  completed in September 2021, upon when the project was put \ninto service.  \nSystem Operation \nOver the last year the system  has continued to respond to sy stem frequency events. System \nfrequency is monitored locally a nd if a deviation is detected the site controller immediately \ndispatches the battery to full  output and discharge for three minutes before ramping down. The \nsystem has automatically responded to approxima tely 47 frequency events since September 2022. \n Table 2 below shows the number of frequency res ponse dispatches of the PW2 battery over the \nlast 12 months. \n \nTable 2 \nMonth and Year  Number of Frequency \nResponse dispatches  \nSeptember 2022  0 \nOctober 2022  8 \nNovember 2022  4 \nDecember 2022  4 \nJanuary 2023  2 \nFebruary 2023  8 \nMarch 2023  5 \nApril 2023  0 \nMay 2023  0 \nJune 2023  6 \nJuly 2023  4 \nAugust 2023  5  PGE UM 1856 2023 Annual Energy Storage Update \nPage | 6 \n \nPreliminary Learnings  \nOur learnings to date include confirmation that the system can  reliably respond to system \nfrequency events and provide that useful grid serv ice to PGE\u2019s operators.

Is the purpose of it clear to you? \nPlease keep in mind that I'll present the incentives for the program to you in an \nupcoming activity. In the meantime, tell me what you think of the concept.  \nFigure 18 Customer Quotes - Smart Battery Respo nse \n \nThere is some distrust of PGE managing customer  systems, but most acknowledge that it \nmakes sense. Several participants mention not liking or needing more information about the \nways in which PGE would be controlling their devices. However, most under stand that if PGE \nis helping with the cost , it is appropriate  the utility  have some control.  \nQ: A component of the Smart Battery Pilot is PGE would occasionally manage your \nbattery\u2019s charging and discharging to support more sustainable energy sources, \nredu ce power outages to all customers, and keep electricity costs low? What do you \nthink about this?  \nFigure 19 Customer Quotes - Managing Battery  \n \nThe program financial incentives were then revealed to participants and asked more \nquestions  of them.  \nSimilar to the last discussion, people liked the concept but lacked enough information to decide either way  and wanted to see a clear and concise breakdown of the costs.  \n  \nUM 1856 PGE 2023 Annual Energy Storage Update \nAttach A Residential Smart Battery Pilot Assessment 2023 \nPage 36\n36Sounds great. Questions that come to mind are installation location, size, \nlife expectancy of the battery, safety with pets or children. \nr \" I think that it is interesting, but adds a lot of questions to if I would \nwant to Inquire about it. It mentions solar panels, and that makes \nme wonder what would I have to do to verify I would qualify for \nthose. Are those included in the set-up? What is the range of the \ncredits? The initial flyer perks my interest and I think the program is \n\\. cool idea once I know more information \n~ \nr \nIt's a great concept. Just depends on costs. I've seen offers for solar \npanels that have you finance them over many years, with the idea that \nyou pay for them from your energy savings. It's all fun and games \nuntil you sell the house. \nIt is not my favorite thing to have PGE involved in this, but since they \nwould help pay for it, I think it would be okay and it may actually help \nthe batteries laat longer. \nI like all concepts of this model but I'd like to fully understand all \nPG E's controls, authorities and usages of this system. \nThis is the whole advantage of the program: it adds a tremendous \namount of decentralized capacitance to the grid. This makes the \ngrid more flexible and resilient for all of us. The social contract is \nthat PGE customers support the capital expense by installing the \nbatteries on their end, in return for the use of those batteries during \noutages. It seems like a fair deal to me--although I would still need \nthe economics to be valid for me as an individual customer, to \nparticipate. I I really like the idea and with the proper incentives it is \nsomething I would definitely be interested in \nThe concept sounds great, but the devil is in the details. How \nmuch will the battery system cost? Like Amanda noted, if we're \nsaving thousands we're likely spending thousands as well. \nI'm very interested in the concept, as it would directly provide \nsome of the backup we are interested in if there were a power \noutage, and I like the idea of contributing to a community-wide \ngrid improvement project. The biggest question is COST, both up\u00ad\nfront and long-term. I'm also curious about how the battery would \nbe sized, since it probably won't be able to sustain an entire \nhousehold for multiple days if there's no grid power \nSeeing that PGE is (partially) kicking in for the cost, I believe it \nmakes sense that they have some control over the battery. They \nare, after all, using it for the benefit of the entire grid, thus they \nwould need to charqe and discharqe as the qrids needs it. \nIf PGE was occasionally managing my batteries charging and ] discharging that sounds ok but I would appreciate a schedule to \nknow when this is taking place. \nr I am curious as to how PGE will manage the battery. In particular, I \nwonder if PGE would ever charge our batteries from the grid and \nwould this effect our tax incentive for installing the battery as part of \nour solar project. My understanding is that the battery must be \nexclusively charged from the solar panels. I do see the need for PGE \nto find creative ways to store energy if we are to ever move beyond \n\\. fossil fuels. \" \n.J",

The second phase (Phase II) of the SGTB seeks to \nexpand upon the research and planning conducted in Phase I, which concluded on December \n31, 2022, to increase PGE\u2019s understanding of how customers perceive and value DR so that PGE may more effectively engage customers in flexible load efforts. All Phase I activities concluded December 31, 2022.   \nTo achieve these goals, PGE is piloting both the Test Bed Smart Solar Study (Smart Solar Study) , \nand Test Bed EV Charging Study (EV Charging Study) , Flexible Feeder, and Multi-Family Bundle  \ndemonstration projects. \n \nSmart Solar Study: PGE will leverage custom er owned \u201csmart inverters\u201d (those equipped \nwith the IEEE 1547-2018 Standard) to assess the value of inverter-based controls to \ndeliver distribution operations value (e.g., Volt/VAR support); address hosting capacity \nissues; and support orchestration of Distributed Energy Resources (DER s) together with \ndistributed solar and storage to minimize grid export. PGE will recruit customers with \nqualifying equipment by offering an upfront incentive in addition to an ongoing monthly incentive for continued enrollment throughout the project duration (January 2023 \u2013 \nDecember 2024). \n EV Charging Study: PGE will communicate with qualifying customer-owned electric \nvehicles (EV) to control the time of EV charging, while ensuring that the vehicles meet the operational needs of participants, and will evaluate customer acceptance of charge rate, charge time and Location-based Price Signals. Research in this project area will focus on \nimproving understanding of the technical paths for charge management, costs, \nperformance, and limitations.

Understand the effectiveness of batteries to support Volt -Var \noptimization.  \nThe ability to utilize advanced inverter capabilities is limited by manufacturer settings and the \nwillingness to support these functionalit ies within the APIs. As shown in  Table 8, none of the \nmanufacturers enable autonomous frequency response or Volt/VA r opti mization .  \nUnderstand the ability of residential batteries to relieve hosting capacity constraints .  \nFor the first half of this study, the ability of batteries to relieve hosting capacity constraints was \nnot evaluated due to the limited participant pool, the technology readiness ( the lack of a VPP) \nand the infancy of the pilot study.  PGE anticipates that as the Pilot matures, and as more \nparticipants are enrolle d, along with PGE\u2019s budding VPP initiative, the batteries will be used \nto relieve hosting capacity constraints.  \n \nUnderstand the compatibility of stacked services, and the prevalence of conflicting \ndispatch p riorities between locational g rid services and b ulk energy services .  \nUM 1856 PGE 2023 Annual Energy Storage Update \nAttach A Residential Smart Battery Pilot Assessment 2023 \nPage 17\n17 Th\ne initial program design was meant to be rudi mentary and as such, lacked the pay for \nperformance model. For the second half of the study, PGE has introduced a pay for \nperformance model and p lans to test these additional ancillary  services.   \nUnderstand the balance of battery use for grid services with customer reserve in the \nevent of an outage.  \nPGE sought to avoid conflicts between dispatch of the devices and instances when there was \na higher than typical likelihood of a power outage. We did this by not dispatching batteries during severe weather  and encouraging customers to prioritize their home resilience.  \nResponse Rate \nTo evaluate the potential for the battery fleet t o perform load shaping and demand response , \nseveral technical tests were conducted, and the performance of the devices was measured \nthrough the DERMS platform.  \nResponse rate was evaluated between each battery manufacturer to ensure that devices were \nresponding appropriately to PGE signals for dispatch and charging. Table 9 show s response \nrates by manufacturer in each year. The \"Response Rate: Total\" column shows the dispatch \nresponse rate for all devices in the row. The  \"Response Rate: Non -Responsive Devices \nExcluded\" column shows the dispatch response rate for devices that responded to at least \none command during the study period. The latter is provided to allow for more accurate projections of dispatch response rates, given the assumption that non -responsive devices will \ncontinue not to respond.   \nResults show that Tesla and SolarEdge (the bulk of the PGE fleet) consistently responded \nwell, but with room for improvement. Reasons for non- response may be related to participant \nbehavior, local settings of the battery, or devices being offline. The second iteration of the \nPilot has a goal to improve device response and participation by providing more direct \nincentives for customers to correct errors, and PGE expects improveme nt in the second half \nof the Pilot.  \nTable 9 Dispatch response rate by manufacturer  \nManufacturer  Number of \nCommands  Response Rate:  \nTotal  Response Rate:  \nNon -Responsive Devices \nExcluded  \nTesla  1137  79% 81% \nSolarEdge  572 59% 69% \nGenerac  19 95% 100% \nSunverge  26 4% N/A%  \nSonnen 1 100% 100%  \nTotal  1755 72% 78% \n  \nUM 1856 PGE 2023 Annual Energy Storage Update \nAttach A Residential Smart Battery Pilot Assessment 2023 \nPage 18\n18 Dispatch Prediction Accuracy \nPGE evaluated the dispatches according to their accuracy, and Figure 2 show s the \ndistribution of reported power output in response to dispatch commands.

In other words, \nhow effectively and accurately the devices respond to communications sent by PGE .  Each \nshape represents the distribution of dispatched power corresponding to the amount \ncommanded by PGE.  \nThe thicker parts of each shape indicate ranges where recorded values are the most likely to \nbe. The commanded dispatch on the X axis is the command sent via the PGE Virtual Peaker \nportal while the response of the battery is recorded on the  Y axis.  Amongst other reasons, \nthe deviation is due to communications delay and conflicting device settings .   \nAs shown below,  variance in recorded power dropped in all categories in 2022 vs 2021, \nmeaning  that the load -shifting ability of th e participating devices has become more reliable \nwith time.  \nFigure 2 Distribution of Recorded Dispatch by Year \n \nFigure 3 shows the relationship between the dispatch rate requested by V irtual Peaker  and \nthe standard deviation of the recorded dispatch in response. Standard deviation is a measure \nof the space between data points; a small standard deviation indicates that the mean \ndispatch is a reliable projection of recorded dispatch.  \nNo significant difference in reliability was found between manufacturers.  One hundred \npercent  (100%) of responding devices reported a non -negligible energy dispatch, although \nthe amount reported was highly variant in trials above 1kW. There is a strong logarithmic \ncorrelation between commanded dispatch power and the standard deviation of the resulting \ndispatch, indicating that lower- power dispatch commands result in a more reliable output.  \nUM 1856 PGE 2023 Annual Energy Storage Update \nAttach A Residential Smart Battery Pilot Assessment 2023 \nPage 19\n192021 2022 \n0 0 \n-1 \u00b1 -1 \u00b1 \u00b1 l l \n-6 -2 -6 -2 ..., ..., \n\u00abl \u00abl \n\"\" \"\" -~ \"' Q i5 \n'O 'O ., -3 ., -3 1: 1: \n0 0 \n(.)

Generally, we set them up to participate, but its up to \nthem to manager their PGE account.\" \nIt's a good idea but the incentives are now unpredictable based on \nparticipation in unpredictable events. The VPP programs in California \nseem to be structured better but it's a hard comparison to make without \nhaving first-hand experience with California VPP, just news reports. To \nput it another way ... the ROI for the battery investment is difficult to \ncalculate and almost impossible to sell to a customer because we have \nno minimum ROI that we can point to, which was one major advantage \nof the $20/$40 flat-rate incentive to participants.\" \n''There hasn't been much information made available to clients \nregarding the program, how it works, what exactly would be happening \nwith their battery, etc. On top of that the payment that were initially \npromised are now being reduced and the new offering is less attractive . \nFor $10 per event or whatever it is now, there isn't a lot to be gained \nfrom installing a specific brand and model and giving PGE access to it, \nwith no guarantee that it won't affect warranty or performance when \nthe client needs it.\" \n\"Very long and demanding application process (signature forms, \nseparate ETO application, plus net metering application) . Would save \ncontractor time and money to simply have the battery pilot application \nas part of the net metering application . Very complicated incentive/pay \nback structure applied to customer's bill.\" \n\"Not well versed in the program.\"  Table 14 Opt -Out Notifications  \nEvent Time  Command(s)  Email \nOption  SMS  \nOption  Devices \nContacted  Opt-\nOuts \n04/13/22, 19:00  Dispatch  Link Manual  70 0 \n04/25/22, 19:00  Dispatch  Link Manual  70 0 \n08/30/22, 15:00  Dispatch  Link Link 102 1 \n09/06/22, 16:00  Dispatch  Link Link 103 1 \n12/15/22, 17:00  Dispatch/Charge  Link Link 117 0 \n12/21/22, 17:00  Dispatch/Charge  Link Link 116 9 \n \nOf the 11 opt -outs that occurred in 2022, 9 were in response to the dispatch and charge \nevents that took place on 12/22/22.  On this date there was a travel advisory for below \nfreezing temperatures, wind gusts and snow and it is likely that customers opted out to \npreserve their resilience in the event of a power outage \u2013 behavior PGE en courages .9 PGE \nbelieves that due to the low number of opt outs and complaints the dispatched events are \nappropriate and well received by participants.  \nOutages \nThe resilience provided by customer batteries is not directly tied to the Smart Battery Pilot \nbut is an important reason for customers\u2019 purchase of their battery . PGE sought to quantify \nthe resilience provided by batteries  and their effectiveness at mitiga ting outages, and \ncreated a metric  dubbed \"Mitigated Customer Minutes of Interrupt ion (MCMI) .10\" This metric \nrepresents the number of minutes during outages that power was available from the  battery \nback -up system. To show outage performance before batteries reach minimum capacity, the \nMCMI of the first hour of each outage was also evaluated.  \nOutage start and end times from PGE\u2019s Outage Management S ystem (OMS)  were paired with \na collection of metrics from  Virtual Peaker . PGE ran current participants through  OMS to \ndetermine when a grid  outage was  detected , then pulled up the same dates in Virtual Peaker. \nThe duration of back -up power provided by the customer\u2019s battery was calculated as  Phouse \nPbattery Psolar 0.2kW, where a negative P battery Psolar values indicate power output.  \nMCMI was defined as the number of minutes during the outage with non- negligible power \nuse and no power from the grid.  \nTable 15 shows the total Customer Minutes of Interrupt ion (CMI) and Mitigated Customer \nMinutes Interrupted ( MCMI) in 2021 & 2022.

        "text": "r I am curious as to how PGE will manage the battery. In particular, I \nwonder if PGE would ever charge our batteries from the grid and \nwould this effect our tax incentive for installing the battery as part of \nour solar project. My understanding is that the battery must be \nexclusively charged from the solar panels. I do see the need for PGE \nto find creative ways to store energy if we are to ever move beyond \n\\. fossil fuels. \" \n.J  Figure 20 Program Incentives Shown to Respondents  \n \nQ: I'd like to get your first impression of the incentive structure for the Smart Battery \nprogram. If you have questions about the incentives,  please feel free to ask.  \nFigure 21 Customer Quotes - Incentive St ructure  \n \nMore cost information was provided to customers based on this feedback. Once they were \ngiven more incentive details, they were split on if it was a good idea. Several thought it was a \ngood deal if you already had solar,  but it wasn\u2019t worth the money if you had to do both at \nonce. For many , the benefits do not outweigh the costs. \nQ: Since there were so many questions about installed cost of a home battery system,  I \nthought I'd post some estimated costs for you. I was able to chat with one of our program folks and they provided this estimate. The estimate includes the PGE \nincentives except for the income- qualified incentive. After taking a look at this, tell me \nhow  that changes your thoughts.  \nUM 1856 PGE 2023 Annual Energy Storage Update \nAttach A Residential Smart Battery Pilot Assessment 2023 \nPage 37\n37You can take advantage of rebates and earn monthly bill credits for participating \nin the Smart Battery program : \n\u2022 Earn $20 a month if your battery can only charge from your solar system. Earn $40 a month if your \nbattery can charge from the PGE system and/or your solar. \nBecause you live in the PGE Smart Grid Test Bed, you can also receive an instant rebate of $1,000 \nto $3,000 toward the cost of installing a battery.* Learn more. \n\u2022 Up to 25 income-qualified customers will receive a $5,000 instant rebate toward the cost of \ninstalling a battery energy storage system when also participating in the Energy Trust's Solar Within \nReach program. \nThere are lots of details that need to be further delineated in the \nincentive description. Why is there a range between 1-3k for the insta \nrebates? If we install an approved battery pack ourselves, are we still \neligible for those rebates? What is the Solar Within Reach program? \nAnd what arc the income qualifications for that program? \nThe incentive structure is interesting, but having to contact \nPGE to understand the details is a roadblock . \nHonestly, It sounds expensive to put in both battery and \nsolar. So if your using solar and the battery backup, you get \n40 per month from PGE? But can you clarify if that's in \naddition to the extra savings from no to low electric costs? \nAnd does PGE then also buy back when your battery is fu/1? $20-40/month sounds like practically nothing, compared to the \nnt expense of installing a battery system. There's a pesky little \nasterisk on the second bullet above with no follow-up, but \npresumably including lots of important information on what to \nexpect for the rebate offered. \nf I'd like to see a breakdown of the costs along side the incentives ] \nto see what the total cost would be \nr The rebates are nice but it's important to note that these aren't paid ' \ndirectly to the customer . Rather the solar I battery installer receives \nthe incentive and it is a component of the overall price of the \ninstalled system. My very biased opinion is that some installers know \nthe incentive you are eligible to receive and don1t competitively \nprice the system, rather the price reflects the additional money \n'-available. .,  Figure 22 Customer Quotes \u2013 Incentive Impact  \n \nPGE next turned to message testing to get feedback on some different marketing \napproaches and language . People were mostly negative toward this email, feel ing that the \ncosts are an immediate turn off  and would discourage them from further pursuing \ninformation about battery energy storage.  \nQ: Would this email encourage you to take action to find out more information about \nthe program or enroll in it?  Why or why not? What don't you like about the email?  \nFigure 23 Email Sentiment  \n \nA letter was tested next  with more verbiage and information . There was more positivity \nbecause it had more information for them; but cost is still an issue . People liked the emphasis \non clean energy and that it is",

In the new version PGE reviews customer performance after each event and provides a log to the customer billing team to process bill credits that reflect actual performance.  This has resulted in increased customer engagement with their battery\u2019s \nperformance, correcting configurations that did not allow for full participation.  \nEnergy Trust Partnership  \nOn April 3, 2023,  PGE conducte d an in -depth interview with the partner administrator at the \nEnergy Trust. This interview was conducted by a PGE employee who does not have direct \ninvolvement with the Smart Battery Pilot. The partnership was designed to serve the customer and the vendor throughout the process of enrolling in this Pilot and to ensure customers \nwere receiving all possible incentives for their installation.  \nThe Energy Trust noted that \u201cwhen [the partnership] is working well\u2026the contractor is \napplying for Energy Trust solar incentives at the same time as the PGE solar incentives\u201d which streamlines the process for all parties involved. The process is designed so that the inventive \ncheck is sent to the installer with both incentives included, rather than the customer needing \nto go between two organizations to reconcile their funds.    \n Furthermore, this Pilot was designed from the outset with the Energy Trust which \u201chas been a \nlearning experience all around.

By responding, the BES can be called upon to partake in a frequency response \nevent. Further, because there are currently no frequency response markets, pricing for \nfrequency response can be challenging, because the RES BES pilot when aggregated will be \nused to provide frequency response, there exists an opportunity cost that needs to be quantified.  \nThe frequency -watt operating boundaries shall be set to autonomously dispatch in support of \ngrid frequency by modulating the power output of the inverter. Control, response, and \noperation data shall be collected from the inverter based on the measured grid frequency \naccording to a frequency -watt droop strict user- defined parameter.  \nThis use case will demonstrate that customer cited BES can help defer capital upgrades to existing generation resources by displacing the frequency response services otherwise provided by conventional generation using aggregated BES systems. \nFast Frequency Response  \nTwo tests of frequency support were perf ormed on March 18th, 2022,  with PGE owned test \nbatteries , a Generac,  and a Tesla . Response times were measured via stopwatch between \nsignal send and response seen by a meter. Each communication pathway was tested 3- 4 \ntimes, and the times were then averaged to get the final performance result.  \nThe first test was to see if residential batteries could respond fast enough to a command given to the battery through the V irtual Peaker  API, and, additionally, if the PGE\u2019s Gen OnSys \nsystem could be used to autonomously send the \"go\" signal to VIRTUAL PEAKER  using pre -\nprogrammed set -points (as Virtu al Peaker  does not have frequency monitoring nor \nautonomous control based on random triggers). The ideal target would have the batteries \nrespond in under 20 seconds, which is the upper time limit for measuring system response to \na frequency event per NERC standards.   \nCommunication Pathways:  \nPath 1:    VP \u2192 Vendor \nCloud  \u2192 Battery -Connected \nRouter  \u2192  Battery  \nPath 2:  Gen OnSys  \u2192 VP \u2192 Vendor \nCloud  \u2192 Battery -Connected \nRouter  \u2192 Battery  \n          \nThe results of the four manufacturer / communication pathway combinations are shown in Table 13; and none of the trials met the 20 -second NERC standard.   \nTable 13 Meter response times by vendor and communication pathway  \nVendor  Communication \nPathway  Average Time to \nRespond  \nTesla  Path 1  59.96  \nTesla  Path 2  61.34  \nGenerac  Path 1  48.05  \nGenerac  Path 2  53.81  \nUM 1856 PGE 2023 Annual Energy Storage Update \nAttach A Residential Smart Battery Pilot Assessment 2023 \nPage 28\n28 None\n of the four manufacturer / pathway combinations responded within the 20 seconds \nnecessary  to credit PGE for the response. Path 1 does not currently have a means of working \nautonomously, and therefore would not be feasible even if response times were i mproved. \nThe conclusion is that residential batteries cannot do fast frequency response using an \noutside command to discharge.  \nFrequency Support  \nAfter the fast frequency response test was found to not be successful, the Pilot initiated a \nsecond test of the  Virtual Peaker \"frequency support\" function, which provides a means of \nhard -coding the batteries to proportionally respond to changes in frequency based on a Hz-\nwatt curve. This function allows residential battery a locally controlled means of providing frequency response.  \nThis test was performed exclusively on Tesla batteries, as Tesla is the only vendor that currently support s the frequency support function through Virtual Peaker . Customers were \nnotified in advance that frequency support would run for 12 hours. All Tesla batteries in the fleet  were programmed with an aggressive Hz- watt curve was used with limited deadband to \nprovide maximum visibility into each battery\u2019s response.  The chosen curve used the following \nVIRTUAL PEAKER  parameters:  \n\u2022 Low Frequency (Hz): 59.985  \n\u2022 Low Freq Delta (Hz): 0.01  \n\u2022 Low Power Delta (W): 1000  \n\u2022 High Frequency (Hz): 60",

The competitive bidding rules \nare triggered due to the size and duration of the resources to be sought in this RFP. \nAs part of this filing, in accordance with OAR 860-089-0010(2),  PGE also requests a \npartial waiver of the competitive bidding rules, including a waiver of OAR 860-089-0200(1), \n \n1 See December 16, 2022 meeting materials at Slide 17, available at: \nhttps://assets.ctfassets.net/416ywc1laqm d/7AUDtFKsutaZB5zUWTzbHo/db4f426352329e0fc05d30f50325b2f7/IRP\n_Roundtable_December_22- 11.pdf   UM 2274 \u2013 PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY\u2019S NOTICE AND REQUEST FOR \nPARTIAL WAIVER OF COMPETITIVE BIDDING RULES     Page 2  OAR 860 -089-0200(2), OAR 860 -089-0250(2)(a ) and OAR 860- 089-0250(3)(g) .

The deferral amount will be for the fixed revenue requirements of the resource less net dispatch benefits.  For purposes of determining dispatch benefits, the forward curves used to set rates for the year under the Annual Power Cost Update will be used.

Francisco Rosales acts as the Program Manager, with day -to-day support provided by PGE contingent project coordinators.  \nManny Obi, PhD acts as the principal technical engineer and performed or oversaw the \ntechnical demonstrations and experiments described within this assessment.  \nPGE has contracted with the Energy Trust to provide implementation support. Th is includes \nmanaging the contractor network, managing and paying program rebates, and performing \ninitial quality assurance and safety audits on the first customer devices to enroll in the Pilot. PGE\u2019s primary contact at the Energy Trust for Pilot implementation is Jeni Hall.  \nDispatch of the battery fleet is handled by a third party Distributed Energy Resource \nManagement System (DERMS) called Virtual Peaker. Virtual Peaker is a cloud -based software -\nas-a-service (SaaS) that manages the dispatch of the batteries for grid services. The dispatch \nof the batteries is typically determined by PGE power operations, in alignment with PGE\u2019s \nother flexible load resources portfolio. The devices are also dispatched according to pilot or \nexperimental needs. The PGE program manager schedules the dispatch within Virtual \nPeaker.   \nCustomer Outreach   \nTo launch the Pilot PGE pre -identified all customers with a qualified energy storage device \nalready  installed at their home and invited them to enroll in the Pilot.  \nOn an ongoing basis there  are two primary paths for a customer to enroll in the Smart Battery \nPilot: a customer may indicate interest during the installation and interconnection process and be automatically prompted to sign -up when the project is complete (\u201ctrickle \nenro llment\u201c ), or through periodic outreach that occurs to customers who PGE knows to \nalready have an eligible battery (campaign enrollment).   \nTo enable the \u201ctrickle enrollment\u201d approach, PGE added a button to the interconnection \napplication form as seen  in Figure 4 7, asking whether the customer was interested in the \nSmart Battery pilot. When a customer whose project installer  clicked that button receives \n\u201cPermission to Operate\u201d from PGE interconnection an automated email is sent inviting them to sign -up. This strategy has a very high success rate of converting prospects to participants.   \nOne suggestion PGE  will investigate for improvement in this is to have all customers with a \nqualified device receive an invitation to sign -up for the Pilot upon receiving Permission to \nOperate, and not just those whose installer indicated interest on the interconnection.  \nUM 1856 PGE 2023 Annual Energy Storage Update \nAttach A Residential Smart Battery Pilot Assessment 2023 \nPage 54\n54 Figure 47: Interconnection Interest  \n \nThe other enrollment process is to reach out to pre -identified customers who have a battery \ninstalled to invite them to participate in a scheduled campaign. These customers \u2019 installer  \nmay not have clicked the button  to opt into the trickle enrolment process or may not have \ncompleted the enrollment, or possibly had a battery installed before Smart Battery Pilot \nlaunch ed.  \nPGE has conducted multiple outreach events to educate and invite customers to learn about the pilot, the benefits of energy storage systems and the rebates available to customers. \nMarketing materials sent to customers are included in Appendix A.   \nPGE also has information about the program on its website at \nportlandgeneral.com/smartbattery. The website provides details about the incentives and the \non-bill rewards available to all customers with an email contact if the customer would like to \nenroll . Finally, the website provides a link to the E nergy Trust of Oregon\u2019s website for \ncustomers interested in installing  a battery system. Customers can submit a request to \nreceive a bid from any of the trade allies.  Between July 1 to September 30, 2023, the website \nreceived over  2,000 visits, 700 of these were mobile access, and 1,400 were desktop access. \nThese number s include repeat visitors.  \nEnrollment  \nCustomers  invited to participate or who receive an enrollment link sign -up directly on PGE\u2019s \nDERMS,  Virtual Peaker.

Docket UM 1857 \nPublic Utility Commission of Oregon \nOctober 17, 2023 \nPage 4 \nOn August 26, 2021, Order No. 21-270 approved Phas e II of PacifiCorp\u2019s Pilot Project 2.  \nOutlined in the proposal were the intentions of  the Company to provide up to ten technical \nfeasibility studies to leadership of  critical facilities interested in learning more about how battery \nstorage might increase resiliency at their site.  Additionally, PacifiCorp was approved to make \nbattery storage project development funding available during two co mpetitive solicitation \nperiods.  Criteria would consid er likelihood of project success,  amount of funding requested, and \ndiversity of project location and facility type.  Applicants woul d be allowed to request grant \nfunding of up to 100 percent of project cost.  In  exchange for grant fund ing, the customer would \nallow PacifiCorp to actively manage a portion of the battery system during normal facility \noperations.  Approval of up to $200,000 was given for technical feasib ility studies, as well as up \nto $1,300,000 for the funding of on-site  battery storage systems.  \nAs per the requirements in Order 21-270, P acifiCorp held a stakeholder workshop on \nSeptember 20, 2021.  The topics covered include d a general overview of the program, proposed \ntimelines, identified research objectives, grant selection criter ia and immediate next steps. \nThe first of two grant applic ation submission windows were opened on October 11, 2021.  The \nwindow was scheduled to close on January 14, 2022, but the Energy Trust of Oregon, speaking \non behalf of facilities working to complete appl ications, requested the window remain open for \nan additional month.  With Commission Staff approval, the applica tion submission window \nremained open until February 18, 2022. \nPacifiCorp received one applicati on for grant funding during this fi rst window.  That application \nrequest was later rescinded, as th e applicant had later determined  the need for reallotment of \ninternal funding sources. The second grant applicati on submission window opened on August 1, 2022, and closed on \nOctober 28, 2022.  Two applications were submitted.  Both applications were approved, and the \nprojects are currently being constructed.  Grant funding will be awarded upon confirmed \ninstallation and interconnecti on of the battery systems. \nTechnical feasibility studies have been pr ovided on a \u201crolling\u201d ba sis, beginning at the \ncommencement of the initial grant applica tion submission window.

PGE conducts  the 2023 RFP in parallel with the Commission\u2019s acknowledgement \nprocess  of PGE\u2019s 2023 IRP (a \u201ctrack two\u201d RFP process).2 PGE\u2019s 2023 IRP and CEP  \ndocket  would run in parallel with the 2023 RFP, which would culminate in \nanticipated Commission decisions regarding acknowledgment of the 2023 IRP and CEP, and 2023 RFP final shortlist in December 2023. While the regulatory review \nof the 2023 IRP and CEP , and the 2023 RFP would run in parallel, PGE anticipates \nthat the ultimate procurement volume will align with the  2023 IRP and CEP action \nplan once PGE\u2019s resource plans are acknowledged . However, due to the need for \nconcurrent processes , the estimated  need outlined in the draft RFP for approval by \nthe Commission would align with the most recently filed  IRP. Additiona lly, as \ndiscussed below, the scoring and modeling methodology would not be discussed in \nthe 2023 IRP, but instead would be reviewed as part of the draft RFP approval \nprocess contemplated under OAR 860- 089-0250 (2)(a) and below.   \n \n2 Track two refer s to OAR 860 -089-0250(2)(a), which states  \u201c[u]nless the electric company intends to use an RFP \nwhose design, scoring methodology, and associated modeling process were included as part of the Commission-\nacknowledged IRP, the electric company must, prior to preparing a draft RFP, develop and file for approval in the \nelectric company's IE selection docket, a proposal for scoring and any associated model ing.\u201d   UM 2274 \u2013 PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY\u2019S NOTICE AND REQUEST FOR \nPARTIAL WAIVER OF COMPETITIVE BIDDING RULES     Page 3  2.

PGE respectfully requests \nthat the Commission allow an exten sion of Bates White , who is already serving as \nan IE as UM 2166 commercial negotiations , continue  and serve as the IE for this \nupcoming solicitation . Additionally, PGE recommends that the Commission allow \nthe review of the scoring and modeling methodology to occur simultaneously with \nthe review of the draft RFP.  Parties would have an opportunity to review and provide \nfeedback on the draft scoring and modeling methodology as part of the review of the draft RFP.  \n3.

And, if you take us up on our offer, we'll enroll you into the PGE Smart Battery Pilot. \nThis program gives you a monthly credit on your bill just for connecting your battery to our grid. \nCustomers enrolled in the Smart Battery Pilot allow PGE to interact with and operate their battery. PGE can send energy to \nthe battery to store and dispatch energy from it to add to the grid. In the event of a power outage, customers retain full \nusage of their battery for use as a power backup. \nWhat can a battery storage system do for you? You might be surprised. \nYou can rely on back-up power if there's an outage. \nYou can earn monthly credits as part of the PGE Smart Battery Pilot program. \nIf you also have solar panels, you'll get the value of that power storage solution. \nA battery lets you store the energy you generate during the day. \nYou can then use that renewable energy at night. \nThese batteries will create a virtual power plant that is made up of small units that can be operated individually or combined \nto serve the grid, adding flexibility that supports PGE's transition to a cleaner energy future. In addition, the batteries provide \nyou with a backup energy resource you can rely on in the event of a power outage.  Q: Wh\nat is your first reaction to this program concept? Is the purpose of it clear to you? \nPlease keep in mind that I'll present the incentives for the program to you in an \nupcoming activity.

The Pilot was developed in  response to Oregon \nlegislat ure\u2019s House Bill 2193 (2015)  and proposed to the Oregon Public Utilities Commission  \n(OPUC)  in UM 1856. \nWhile PGE sought to study a full spectrum of grid services, t he batteries were primarily \ndispatched for peak shaving or demand response purposes , in addition to experimental \ndispatches for use case testing. As shown in Figure 1, the pilot has shown steady growth of \nparticipants and available energy , providing 1.26 MWh of energy during peak events in \n2021, 4.88 MWh in 2022 , and 6.56 MWh  in 2023 YTD  (through August) .  \nFigure 1 Pilot Growth  \n \nThere were technical limitations to the ability for more advanced grid services, with the \nmanufacturer API s (Application Program ming Interface each having their own functionalities \nlocked or unlocked.

Very few customers opt out of dispatch events , at only 1.9% \nacross all events that offered an opt out option. The batteries reduced the durations of \ncustomer outages by 61% .  \nA survey of participating installers identified interest in streamlining enrollment as well as a \ndesire for more Pilot  details to aid  installers with customer engagement.

During the event period, \nthe frequency support mode did not interrupt other battery functions, such as solar self -\nconsumption or TOU optimization. Total kWh performance of each battery was partly \ndependent on other  modes and functions the customer was using the device for at the time \nof the event. \nBecause kWh performance of each battery was partly dependent on other modes and \nfunctions the customer was using the device for at the time of the event, actual performanc e \ncan only be verified by checking the battery activity graph for each individual enrolled device. \nThis creates a challenge for scale -able verification of performance for a pay-for- performance \ntariff. Because high -frequency metering was not available at each battery, it was not possible \nto determine whether the battery responded within the necessary window to frequency deviation. The results indicate that Tesla batteries may be able to provide frequency response in small amounts (per -battery) without needin g to be used exclusively for that \npurpose. To confirm viability, the Tesla battery group\u2019s speed of response to frequency events will need to be verified.  \nSince the battery\u2019s charge or discharge activity will be based on how severely frequency deviates from 60 Hz, the battery\u2019s contribution will typically be less than what we could achieve with an autonomous command as was tested above, but in aggregate the response \nmay still be significant with many batteries operating on this curve.  \nUM 1856 PGE 2023 Annual Energy Storage Update \nAttach A Residential Smart Battery Pilot Assessment 2023 \nPage 30\n30Updated o few seconds ogo \n.. \n01:09AM \n\u25a0e..&lefy~ 3M \n~ : :=:::. ~ !!: \n\u2022 8.lt'lefy~ (ngt,1- ) S.$8$ ~... ~... ~ ... \nUpdated a few seconds ogo Battery History \n08/15/2021 \nBattery History \n08f1&'2021 --\n---\n,u ... \nExpo,t  EPRI StorageVET  \nPGE so ught to better understand the accuracy of PGE\u2019s modeling inputs to EPRI StorageVET \nand its suitability as a planning tool that can inform IRP values for use cases as part of the \nPilot.

This Pilot has allowed the Energy \nTrust t o test out the up- front rebate programming model, something that they plan to take \nlearnings from and potentially use for future programming. Overall, \u201cthis model of \npartnership is working, and is going in the direction it should be.\u201d  \nOne area of improveme nt between the two organizations is creating a more streamlined \nexperience via Virtual Peaker. Currently, the customer is responsible for getting their battery \nsystem enrolled into the Virtual Peaker cloud system, the Energy Trust noted that they would \nlike to \u201csee this shift to the contractor to support, rather than have this burden on the \ncustomer.\u201d If the vendor was gathering all the information needed for commissioning at the \ntime of installation and inputting this to Virtual Peaker, it would avoid what  currently \u201cfeels like \na huge lag for the customer\u201d between the arrival of the battery and receiving permission to \noperate from PGE.  \nFinally, a larger challenge that faces PGE in nearly all programming is the ability to share data \nquickly and efficiently across outside partner organizations. It is no different for this Pilot, the \nEnergy Trust noted that the overarching agreement between the two organizations make it \ndifficult to share resources that pertain to customer data, while this protects customer information, the practical impact of this is it can increase processing time for customers.   \nSince the Covid -19 pandemic, supply chain has been a major challenge for customers \ninstalling battery storage. While these challenges have improved over time, the E nergy Trust \nnoted that obtaining devices quickly for customers has \u201cbeen a major challenge, but because \nUM 1856 PGE 2023 Annual Energy Storage Update \nAttach A Residential Smart Battery Pilot Assessment 2023 \nPage 61\n61 PG\nE and the Energy Trust are a little bit more flexible [than other organizations], we\u2019ve been \nable to support vendors\u201d when they have faced supply chain challenges.   \nBeyond supply chain, delays for processing new trade allies were identified by the Energy \nTrust as an opportunity for improvement. \u201cRight now, the rebate is provided up front, so \nthere is no financial incentive for the Trade Ally to turn in  the paperwork\u201d this results in the \nTrade Allies focusing on the next sale rather than completing the required documentation in a timely manner. This can result in delays for the customer and has been noted as an \nopportunity for the Energy Trust to improve  the overall turnaround time of this process.  \nThe Energy Trust is working to identify ways to better communicate across the vendor \nnetwork. They are working to develop new collateral and communications designed to give vendors the information they need bu t also provide them with information to pass to the \ncustomer to ensure consistency across everyone involved. The Energy Trust\u2019s Administrator \nnoted that \u201cthere is always something changing [in relation to the Pilot], whether it\u2019s grants, \nincentives, or program options\u201d so ensuring that the vendors and customers have the most up-to-date information has been a challenge.  \nFurthermore, vendors have reported to the Energy Trust that simply having the word \u201cPilot\u201d \nin the title of the Smart Battery Pilot has made  them \u201cuncertain of the program, and they want \nto protect their customers. They\u2019re not going to push it too hard unless they can count on it \nsticking around and remaining consistent.\u201d PGE expects that with the future transition of this Pilot to Program status, this issue should be resolved.  \nFuture Pilot Considerations  \nThe Pilot  has an expiration date of July 31st, 2025 , and at that time it can either apply to be \nextended, sunset , or transition to a program with the same or updated structure. At this time, \nit is PGE\u2019s hope and intent that the pilot will be replaced with a scalable and cost -effective \nstructure and  will continue to pursue learnings in the next two years that will inform this \ntransition.   \nIncreasing Energy Storage Adoption  & Pilot Enrollment  \nThere are two primary barriers to increasing Pilot uptake: the first is simply the number of \ncustomers with a battery installed at their home, and the second is encouraging eligible \ncustomers to enroll in the Pi lot once their battery is installed. There are just over 800 batteries \ninstalled in PGE\u2019s service territory, representing about 0.1% of all customers. Seventy -five \npercent (75%) of all batteries installed are qualified for the Smart Battery Pilot however, and  \nalmost a quarter (24%) of those eligible are currently participating in the Pilot.  \nFor the first issue, batteries remain quite expensive and forecasts that battery storage systems \nwould drop in price since first being introduced to the residential market  have not \n",

These events were typically called for \nmeteorological reasons, such as for high heat or low temperatures that put st rain on the grid \nnecessitating the usage of higher emitting peaker plants and/or more expensive marginal \npower .

Currently the tariff limits the Pilot to Schedule 7, however there are residential \ncustomers on Schedule 32 with , for example, a shop or garage who are not able to \nparticipate due to the tariff language  and cannot enroll their battery in Peak Time Rebates \nsince they are not on Schedule 7 , nor Energy Partner since they are residential . Other entities \nthat may benefit from  expanding the eligibility of Smart Battery are non -residential customers \nwho have a residential scale battery. PGE has customers such as synagogues & churches, \nvineyards, an d other small businesses that are being encouraged to enroll in Energy Partner, \nhowever we believe that Smart Battery may be a better fit for those small , directly \ndispatchable devices.

The Pilot\u2019s goal has been  to optimize \nlearnings  while in this early phase and to enable the int egrations and investments in backend \ninfrastructure necessary to support the pilot , and any transition s to the next phase.  \nDistributed customer- sited batteries like those in the pilot are expected to play an increasing \nrole in providing a zero- emission capacity resource.  PGE is developing a Virtual Power Plant \n(VPP) that can utilize various DER connected to the distribution system and provide reliable \ngrid services that typically are provisioned by centralized power plants. The current Smart \nBattery pilot design has focused on early operational learnings on how to communicate with, \nremotely dispatch, and validate performance of the battery fleet, and therefore has not evolved into fully optimized dispatch and integration with other DERs. For example, most event calls have coincided with system- wide capacity calls during resource adequacy \nperiods, which is an important value stream but is not reflective of the full flexibility from batteries capable of dispatching for daily energy optimization and load shifting purposes. PGE plans to model more robust optimized dispatch scenarios to inform future cost -\neffectiveness evaluation and program design considerations.   \nAs this pilot matures and number of participants increases, careful consideration of the \nbalance between customer incentives and grid service value will be important. Although the pilot design was geared at a small sample to test the technology, communication needs, and participant behavior, these learnings are expected to translate into a more robust p rogram \ndesign capable of leveraging larger scale procurements and enrollment targets that can help buy- down per -unit integration costs. These strategies can be expected to result in reduction \nof program delivery costs and combined with the inclusion of more optimized dispatch for \ngrid services, will help the pilot on the way to becoming cost -effective.  \n  \nUM 1856 PGE 2023 Annual Energy Storage Update \nAttach A Residential Smart Battery Pilot Assessment 2023 \nPage 64\n64 Appendix A : Customer Communications  \n \n \nSmart Battery o ne pager providing program overview and benefits to be used at events \nwhere PGE has a presence. \nUM 1856 PGE 2023 Annual Energy Storage Update \nAttach A Residential Smart Battery Pilot Assessment 2023 \nPage 65\n65PGE Smart Battery Pilot \nMaklng the most out of a home battery system \nLaunched in 2020.

The second phase (Phase II) of the SGTB seeks to \nexpand upon the research and planning conducted in Phase I, which concluded on December \n31, 2022, to increase PGE\u2019s understanding of how customers perceive and value DR so that PGE may more effectively engage customers in flexible load efforts. All Phase I activities concluded December 31, 2022.   \nTo achieve these goals, PGE is piloting the Test Bed Smart Solar Study (Smart Solar Study), Test \nBed EV Charging Study (EV Charging Study), Flexible Feeder, and Multi-Family Bundle demonstration projects.  \nSmart Solar Study: PGE will leverage custom er owned \u201csmart inverters\u201d (those equipped \nwith the IEEE 1547-2018 Standard) to assess the value of inverter-based controls to \ndeliver distribution operations value (e.g., Volt/VAR support); address hosting capacity \nissues; and support orchestration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) together with distributed solar and storage to minimize grid export. PGE will recruit customers with qualifying equipment by offering an upfront incentive in addition to an ongoing monthly incentive for continued enrollment throughout the project duration (January 2023 \u2013 \nDecember 2024). \n EV Charging Study: PGE will communicate with qualifying customer-owned electric \nvehicles (EV) to control the time of EV charging, while ensuring that the vehicles meet the operational needs of participants, and will evaluate customer acceptance of charge rate, charge time and Location-based Price Signals. Research in this project area will focus on \nimproving understanding of the technical paths for charge management, costs, \nperformance, and limitations. Customers within the EV Charging Study test bed with qualifying electric vehicles will opt in to receive an ongoing monthly incentive throughout the project duration (January 2023 \u2013 December 2024).  \nFlexible Feeder Study: The flexible feeder study seeks to explore the potential benefit of \na concentrated number of connected DERs providing support to the grid. PGE will provide \nincentives, in addition to those offered to customers when enrolling in the respective DER programs, to promote installation of flexible load enabling and enhancing technologies within the project area. Eligible DERs include qualifying smart thermostats, battery energy storage systems, smart inverters, smart wate r heaters, and electric vehicles.

Upon comp letion, PacifiCorp agreed to fi le a final Phase I report and a \nrevised plan estimating the costs and identifying the anticipated benefits of expanding the Pilot \nProject 2 into Phase II.  \nOn December 18, 2020, PacifiCorp file d its final Phase I report fo r the Pilot Project 2.  That \nreport contained severa l notable learnings: \n1)Battery energy storage can reduce critical fa cility dependency on fu el deliveries and\ninfrastructure corridors that provide relief se rvices during disaster events, contributing\nto a more resilient back-up system than  a standard back-up generator alone may\nprovide.\n2)There are limited funding opportu nities to develop battery energy storage resources,\nand current rates do not incentivize energy storage.  In the absence of an economic\ncase to support battery energy storage adop tion, the Pilot Project 2 suffered lower-\nthan-expected participation and follow-t hrough from initial conve rsations with many\npotential program participants.\n3)Commercial facilities\u2019 adoption rates of battery energy storag e systems in Oregon\nremain low, in part because the econ omics of battery energy storage are not\ncompetitive with the alternat ive fossil fuel back-up pow er options.  Appropriately\ndesigned policy mechanisms\u2014including in centives, grant funding programs, and\nbeneficial tariff design\u2014can encourage battery energy storage adoption and promote\nwidespread resiliency bene fits throughout Oregon.\n4)As adoption of commercial-scale batter y energy storage resources increases,\nPacifiCorp will need to develop its capabili ties to effectively manage battery energy\nstorage resources in order to harness the a ssociated grid services benefits for its\nratepayers.\nBased on those learnings, PacifiCorp believed th at an expanded community resiliency offering \nhad the potential to offer an array of benefits  to its critical fac ility customers and the \ncommunities they serve, its ratepayers, and the Oregon battery energy storage industry.

Different utilities have different values for services at both the bulk \nsystem level and the distribution level, so financial modeling must be done in advance to \nfeed DER -VET's models.  \nWith the financial values of services as an input to DER -VET, for batteries that have no limit s \non operation (ability to charge, ability to export), the value of batteries scales up regardless of location on a $/kW & $/kWh basis, due to bulk system services making up the majority of DER \nvalue except in future cases where energy storage can be targeted for an NWS  project. Due \nto this, DER -VET is largely used now for its resilience simulation metrics for prospective \nmicrogrid projects.  \nContin gency Reserve  \nAccording to the National renewable Energy Labs (NREL), contingency reserves are capacity services that are set aside as backup and are enough to cover the unplanned disconnection or outage of a large generator or transmission line and these reserves are required to \nmaintain system balance. Contingency reserve is required for the reliable operation of the \ninterconnected power system. Adequate generating capacity must always be available to maintain scheduled frequency and avoid loss of firm load following transmission or generation contingencies. NERC requires that PGE plans for both spinning and non -spinning \nreserves. BES can be used for spinning contingency reserves since they are online and can respond immediately. The BES can also be reserv ed for non -spinning reserves. In both cases, \nthis can be achieved by reserving a fraction of the BES for a period, as a contingency reserve. \nWe define the seasonal reserve as a percentage of each connected BES.\n8 This available \ncapacity in each BES must at  no time fall below the sum of the minimum threshold stipulated \nby the BES OEM and the contingency reserves stipulated in this document. \nTo utilize the Smart Battery Pilot for contingency reserves the Pilot must be directly \nconnected in with PGE\u2019s balancing authority so that the batteries may provide the necessary \npower within seconds to minutes of an event occurring. This is not practical with manual \ndispatch , although the batteries have the techni cal capability to discharge in response to a \nsignal . One  pathway to connect a battery into the Balancing Authority is through GenOnSys , \n8 Suggested reserve may vary by manufacturer and un it rated capacity . \nUM 1856 PGE 2023 Annual Energy Storage Update \nAttach A Residential Smart Battery Pilot Assessment 2023 \nPage 31\n31 whi\nch would send a dispatch signal to Virtual Peaker to discharge the batteries. PGE \nsuccessfully completed a demonstration  for this dispatch pathway but did not sustainably \nimplement it. The benefits and practicality of completing this pathway will be evaluated in the \nsecond half of the Pilot.  \nObjective 3: Customer Impact \nCustomer Discussion Board  \nIn December 2021 PGE fielded research to understand customers \u2019 experience with power \noutages, discover their familiarity and interest with our Smart Battery pilot program, and open \na discussion about what they might want or need from the program to opt for  getting a \nbattery. Using the program description itself to discover what customers did and did not like \nabout this program and decipher what types of barriers are keeping customers from purchasing a battery.  \nPGE used the Customer Conversations qualitative research platform to engage  potential  \nhome battery candidates over a two- week period.  The platform enables asynchronous \nconversations with participants. The Conversation ran from Dec 8th to Dec 17th and 47 individuals participate d.  Only two customers already owned a home battery energy storage \nsystem , and six had solar panels. The majority live in a single -family home and one lives in a \nmulti -family home.  \nThe first set  of question s posed for the customer discussion w ere around power outages .  \nLack of heat, food loss, and lack of cell service/internet we re the most mentioned impacts  of a \nloss of power. Many participants mentioned the February 2021 outage and the negative \neffects it had on them.

Many \nrespondents th ink they are prepared for a few days, but few feel prepared for a longer -term \noutage. Despite this lack of longer -term preparedness many believe that installing a back -up \npower resource is too costly to be worth it.  \nQ: First I'd like to ask you how power outages have impacted you and your household. \nI'm speaking of power outages in general, so if you have not had an outage experience with",

The \nCommission opened Docket No. UM 1751 in September 2015 to implement HB 2193, and, in \nCommission Order No. 16 -504, adopted guidelines  and requirements for energy storage \nproposals and a framework for the Energy Storage Potential Evaluations. The order encouraged PGE to \u201csubmit multiple, differentiated projects that test varying technologies or applications.\u201d \nPGE filed its residential  energy storage proposal and final Energy Storage Potential \nEvaluation on November 1, 2017, in Docket No. UM 1856. Commission Order No. 18 -290 \napproved a stipulation filed by PGE and provided conditional approval for the five -year Pilot.   \nThe Pilot sought to install and connect 525 customer -owned residential battery energy \nstorage systems to contribute up to four megawatts of energy to PGE\u2019s grid. These batteries \nwould comprise a virtual power plant of distributed assets that could be operated individually \nor in concert for grid services including flexibility, a grid service necessary to support PGE\u2019s \ntransition to a clean energy future. Customer batteries enrolled in the Pilot would further \nprovide customers with electricity resilience.  \nThe Commission required  PGE to submit an addendum to OPUC Staff (Staff) that detailed \nhow PGE will optimize learnings and mitigate risks. Staff would then evaluate and determine \nwhether PGE provided adequate evidence to allow the Company to move forward with the \nproposed pilot.   \nPGE submitted Advice No. 20- 08/Docket No. ADV 1111 to establish a new Schedule 14 \nResidential Battery Storage Pilot in April 2020.

Use cases PGE sought to study include \nautonomous Volt/Var support, localized demand response for the provision of \ndistribution congestion relief , and upgrade deferral.  \nThe Energy Portfolio:  Evaluate the ability of P ilot participant s\u2019 batteries to stack values \nrelevant to PGE\u2019s bulk energy portfolio.  These use cases include generation capacity, \nenergy resource optimization , contingency reserves , and autonomous frequency \nresponse .  \nCustomer Impact : Evaluate customer ame nability to PGE control of the battery, \npreference for up -front rebate or ongoing compensation, hurdles to battery adoption,  \ntarget market, messaging, device communication, etc.  \nThe Program Design:  Evaluate how PGE can cost -effectively implement and receive \n value fr om this Pilot.  \nAssessment  Approach \nWhen initially proposed to the OPUC, PGE envisioned using a  third -party evaluator  for the \nPilot  hired through an RFP process. However, while conducting the Pilot and reviewing the \ncapabilities of third -party vendors , an internal assessment was conducted  on the need for a n \nevaluator due to the unique nature of the Pilot that set s it apart from other flexible load pilots. \nSpecifically, during the initial phase of th e Pilot, PGE was focused on  more technical aspects \nof the roll -out, such as  communications set-up and dispatch testing ; topics capable of \nevaluation  by PGE\u2019s internal experts.   \nAdditionally,  batteries and the reporting enabled by the inverter metrology are sophisticated \nand detailed enough that the complex evaluations typically performed by third -party \nevaluators is not required to determine program impact s. For example,  a reading of the \nevent  performance is available to PGE in near- real time data without the need to perform \ncomplicated",

I'm \nthinking about investing in one as well. \nold at the time). It got cold very fast in our house and I was surprised to \ndiscover that even our gas furnace couldn't run without electricity. Maybe \nthat seems obvious, but you'd think that a non-electric furnace should be \n'-able to keep going, maybe with a small, dedicated battery backup. \nI We've had a few power outages in the past couple of years ... the outage \nduring the ice storm was about a week long and was fairly disruptive for \nus since I work from home \nThe most significant power outage was Valentine's weekend 2021. A \nneighbor's tree fell on the power line for our dead end street. Not only \nwere we without power, heat, cell service, but we were also trapped on our \nroad. Because it only effected the houses on our block, despite a \nneighborhood cluster of outages, we were not high on the priority list. The \nfact that live wires impeded entry and exit was beyond troublesome. \nOther than candles, and backup files for my business, I have no real \nbackup for power outages. \nWe have candles, flashlights , Coleman lanterns, lights you can hand \ncrank, and a small battery that can be used to charge cell phones. \nWe also have one of those saucers that we take out and put wood \nin. I have a small pile of wood that could be used to make a fire to \ncook with. We also have food that does not require heat. \nPeople lived without power for a very long time. We would be fine. I haven't experienced a power outage in years, and I'll \nprobably never have a power outage again since I purchased \nlarge batteries that recharge themselves using my solar \nproduction; the batteries are Tesla Powerwalls, but other \ncompanies make systems that do the same thing. I've had full \npower in my home even when the grid was down in my \nneighborhood (including the February 2021 event in Portland) \nand the switchover between grid and batteries is almost \ninstantaneous. Prior to my battery system, I hated power \noutages (such a huge disruption to activities}, which was part \nof the reason I purchased my Tesla Powerwalls. \nThe hardest power outages are when it happens for days and \nyou lose your food! That's expensive! \nThe most consequential step we have taken in to add solar to our \nhome and a backup battery at some point in the future when Tesla \nfigures out how fill their backorders. We also learned from last \nwinter's ice storm the value of extra batteries and candles. \nYes, we have basics like an army of candles, small propane tank, \nfirewood , gas fireplace insert/water heater, and a generator. I'd love \nhave a battery option with maybe a solar panel system to charge it, \nbut there are significant costs to implementing those systems which \nis hard to squeeze into a typical family budget. \nWe have flashlights and a few candles Gas water heater, stove, and fireplace.

Confidential information in this filing is provided in \naccordance with General Protective Order No. 17-274. \nPilot Project 1\u2014Energy Storage Solution \nOn April 2, 2018, PacifiCorp selected for Commission approval in this docket the \ntwo megawatt/s\nix megawatt-hour (MWh) base case energy storage solution as the preliminary \nsizing for the proposal, as descri bed in Section 4.0 of the Final Oregon Energy Storage Project \nProposal document (Pilot Project 1).  This sizing met the minimu m threshold of fi ve MWh as set \nforth by House Bill 2193, accommodates the histor ic outage characterization on the feeder, and \npresented the lowest risk option given the inform ation available to PacifiCorp at the time.  \nPacifiCorp now provides an addi tional update on the current status of this project.  \nThe Company originally planned to construct this project on land near the Hillview Substation in \nCorvallis, Oregon.  After an exhaustive sear ch of available property with willing property \nowners, it was determined that the only viable la nd would result in the removal of at least one \nresidence and displacement of th e occupant.  Following consulta tion with Commission staff, \nPacifiCorp restarted the search fo r available property looking at other locations both in Corvallis \nand across PacifiCorp\u2019s Oregon service territory .  One location that is fed from the Lakeport \nSubstation located in Klamath Falls , was identified as a good candidate that allows for all of the \nhigh-level use cases.  The Company engaged in negotiations for the use of a portion of a vacant parcel of land on which the Company intends to  acquire a termed exclusive easement.  The \neasement was secured in September 2023.  \nThe Owner\u2019s engineering is being provided by an external engineering firm and was procured \nthrough competitive bid and awarded at the end of 2018.  The Owner\u2019s Engineer was selected \nbased on lowest bid.  The winning bid was for [B\n egin Confidential]   [End \nConfidential] .  This cost is in addition to the internal engineering reviews and project \nmanagement.  The combined costs were origin ally estimated to be approximately $60,000; \nREDACTED Docket UM 1857 \nPublic Utility Commission of Oregon \nOctober 17, 2023 \nPage 2 \nhowever, based on current estimate s and awarded contracts, this portion of the project is now \nestimated to be $255,000.  The Owner\u2019s Engineer s have completed the conceptual design, \ninterconnection application, and permitting review.  Following th e initial reviews performed by \nthe Owner\u2019s Engineer, it was deemed that the Co mpany\u2019s internal engineer ing team could review \nthe detailed designs for a lower cost, therefore these services were shifted to PacifiCorp\u2019s \ninternal engineering teams.   \nThe engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) request for proposals issued in 2019 did \nnot receive any qualified bid responses.

Categorical income qualification is \nthe process by which if a customer has shown documentation to be  enrolled in one  program \nor offering , they are automatically qualified to enroll in another.  \nThis offering proved to be popular, with the rebates being fully claimed by March 22, 2022.  \nAs of September 14, 2023, 23 of the customers who received the rebate had completed \nprojects and two were still in progress.

PGE is working directly \nwith the customer  to resolve this , upon resolution,  the rebate will be released.  \nPGE w as surprised at the fast  uptake of the income -qualified rebate s versus the very slow \nuptake for the Smart Grid Testbed ones, and suspects that the narrow geographic restriction \nintended to induce geographic density is the culprit . When the rebate is available service-\nterritory wide there is sufficient  demand, even among a more narrowly defined customer \nbase , but if PGE wants to encourage customers who otherwise are not planning on installing \na battery to do  so, more than $3,000 is needed.  \nPGE has cost information from 18 of the 25 customers who applied for an income -qualified \nrebate.  \n\u2022 16 installed both solar and storage, and two added a ba ttery to an existing solar array.  \n\u2022 The highest gross system cost was $109,551, which included solar and storage, and \nthe lowest gross sy stem cost was $13,248 for a battery only .  \n\u2022 The average gross cost was $56,129.  \n13 Portland General Electric \u201cAdvice No. 20- 08 docketed as 1 111\u201d (April 21, 2020) \nhttps://edocs.puc.state.or.us/efdocs/UAA/uaa1570.pdf  \nUM 1856 PGE 2023 Annual Energy Storage Update \nAttach A Residential Smart Battery Pilot Assessment 2023 \nPage 58\n58 \u2022 The n\net cost to customers, inclusive of tax credits, Energy Trust rebates and PGE \nrebates ranged from $8,248 - $50,874.  \n\u2022 The largest t otal discount through incentive s was $36,625 while the smallest was \n$5,000 \u2013 the rebate from PGE on a battery install only.  \n\u2022 The average total discount was $20,358.50.  \n\u2022 Twenty customers  installed one battery , while three installed  two batteries , and o ne \napiece installed three and four batteries.   \nDevice Dispatch & Participation  \nParticipants receive both a text message and email about a day prior to any scheduled \ndispatches of their battery device, programmed through  Virtual Peaker. While not a program \nrequirement, PGE strives to keep customers informed of activity with their battery and keep \ncustomers informed of pilot activity.  \nA customer does not need to do anything to participate in an event, the DERMS software will \nsend a sig nal to dispatch the battery to provide the requested amount of power at the \nscheduled time. The customer\u2019s local settings, however, will always take precedence over a \nPGE signal during an event. For example, the customer may opt out of an event through their \nbattery\u2019s app, override the signal manually, or if the battery does not have enough capacity to fulfill the request the device will automatically cease dispatch when it hits the pre- set limit of \nreserved energy.  \nIn the first iteration of the Pilot PGE was typically dispatching 3 kW for 3 hours, for a total of 9 \nkWh for each peak time event. Even though some customers had larger devices and more available capacity, the Pilot was structured to compensate every household the same and ask \nfor the same capacity during events. As such the Pilot chose an amount available from the \nsmallest device participating in the program since there was not the built in sophistication to dispatch and compensate customers for differing amounts. A key update that the Pilot mad e \nin the second iteration was to allow for customers with more capacity to participate at a higher level, which as  previously discussed and  illustrated in Figure 50 unlocked significant \nadditional Pilot capacity.  \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \nUM 1856 PGE 2023 Annual Energy Storage Update \nAttach A Residential Smart Battery Pilot Assessment 2023 \nPage 59\n59 Figure 50 Pilot Growth  \n \nIn the",

PGE withdrew the Second Revision of Sheet No. 13-4 due to pagination in Advice No. 22-24. \n \n Portland General Electric \n121 SW Salmon Street\u2022 Portland, OR 97204 \nportlandgeneral .com  PGE Advice No. 23-17  \nPage 2 \n \n The Schedule 13 update also in cludes provisions to implement the Multifamily New \nConstruction Study consistent with the Commission\u2019s approval of the implementation plan \nin Order 23-258, which will prov ide equipment incentives to  participating multi-family \nproperties to support the inst allation of flexible load en abled heat pump water heating \nequipment. \n This filing does not include tariff updates for ei ther of the two other studies approved by \nthe Commission in Order No. 23-258, the Singl e Family New Construction demonstration \nor the Multi-family Retrofit study. The development of the Si ngle Family New Construction \ndemonstration will benefit from  additional outreach and collabora tion with potential builder \nparticipants to better define the market need and to inform the most effective incentive \nstructure. Further refi nement over the remainder  of the year will info rm future contracting \nand/or tariff updates for the impl ementation phase. The extension of a tariff filing for the \nSingle Family New Construc tion demonstration does not impac t any of the other testbed \nstudies nor any existing PGE programs.  For the Multi-family Retrofit  study, PGE has determined the project plan and incentive \nstructure as proposed does not  align well with t he intended focus of the SGTB since \nadoption of flex load-ready equipment is no w occurring naturally through building code \nrequirements. Equipment incentives are not seen as primary driver s for this adoption. \nTherefore, PGE hopes to ali gn SGTB efforts in support of  existing ongoing programmatic \nupdates, specifically the relaunc h of the Multi-family Water Heater Pilot (Schedule 4). \nPGE intends to leverage the technical work mo ving forward in the SGTB Multi-family New \nConstruction studies to inform the updates being made to the Multi-family Water Heater \nPilot and intends to develop and share pr oposed next steps with the DRRC for how the \nMulti-family Retrofit budget can best support these efforts. \n The Single Family New Construction and Mu lti-family Retrofit  studies, along with \nadditional demonstration projects, will be incorpor ated in a future tariff update as SGTB \nPhase II continues.  Attachment A contains enrollment and in centive estimates for the Flex Feeder \ndemonstration.   A courtesy redline of Sc hedule 13 is attached. \n To satisfy the requirem ents of OAR 860",

        "text": " There are just over 800 batteries \ninstalled in PGE\u2019s service territory, representing about 0.1% of all customers. Seventy -five \npercent (75%) of all batteries installed are qualified for the Smart Battery Pilot however, and  \nalmost a quarter (24%) of those eligible are currently participating in the Pilot.  \nFor the first issue, batteries remain quite expensive and forecasts that battery storage systems \nwould drop in price since first being introduced to the residential market  have not \nmaterialized. Cost is listed as the primary barrier among potential participants, and even with \nUM 1856 PGE 2023 Annual Energy Storage Update \nAttach A Residential Smart Battery Pilot Assessment 2023 \nPage 62\n62 in\ncentives the up -front costs of these systems are not low enough to sway customers who \nwould not otherwise seek out a battery storage system.14 \nVendo rs and PGE\u2019s key partner, the Energy Trust, cite that supply chain challenges presented \nsignificant barriers to adoption during and shortly after the COVID -19 pandemic. Customers \nwho wanted battery systems were unable to procure them or faced extensive wai t times for \ndeliver y.15 \nWhen the Pilot tried to encourage adoption of energy storge with the Smart Grid Testbed \nupfront rebates we found that the $3,000 offer was not enough funding to  induce a purchase, \nso the Pilot will try again with a revamped rebate structure of $405 per kWh , in the hopes that \nthis restructured incentive and a comprehensive outreach campaign in collaboration with the \nEnergy Trust will encourage adoption for locational density.  \nAdditionally, customers cite the importance of ease of installation . While many do say that \ntheir installation was very or somewhat easy, there are still 27% of customers that found it difficult. This impacts the way they talk about the battery device to others.  PGE is reliant on \nthe Energy Trust to manage this installer network and has limited control over the customer \nexperience with this phase of the process. Likewise, installers report lower levels of \nsatisfaction and likelihood to recommend the Pilot to cust omers . There appears to be an \nopportunity for improvement for PGE to partner closer with the trade allies to ensure they have the desired information about the Pilot and to improve their willingness to recommend installing a battery and participating in the Pilot to their customers.  \nAs we continue to see weather events that highlight the need for home resilience products, PGE expects to see an increase in customer interest and adoption of home battery backup systems. The customers who cur rently participate in the Pilot cite that obtaining resilience  \n(61% rank resilience as their top motivator)  and increasing their use of carbon- free energy are \nthe top two motivations for purchasing a BESS .\n16  \nGenerally, customer s participating in the Pilot  are satisfied and highly likely to recommend it  \nto others , with 75% saying they are very likely and another 22% saying they are somewhat \nlikely.17 The best way to enroll a customer appears to be right when they have installed their \ndevice, and PGE will co nsider adjusting the process for sending the automated enrollment \nemail to all qualified  customers versus only those whose installer has opted them in.  \nAmong those who are not currently in the program, familiarity with the Pilot is low. Despite a lack of familiarity, customers do express interest in enrolling  when presented with details of \nthe Pilot.\n This suggests that with marketing materials designed to address specific questions \naround cost, installation, and pilot details, additional customers may choose to enroll. 18 PGE \nhas done many marketing campaigns to perform outreach to customers with a qualified \n14 Portland General Electric, \u201cSmart Battery Pilot Evaluation\u201d (2021)  \n15 Energy Trust of Oregon Interview, Portland General Electric (April 3, 2023)  \n16 Ibid \n17 Ibid \n18 Portland General Electric, \u201cSmart Battery Pilot Evaluation\u201d (2021)  \nUM 1856 PGE 2023 Annual Energy Storage Update \nAttach A Residential Smart Battery Pilot Assessment 2023 \nPage 63\n63 batt\nery to make them aware of the Pilot, and continues to explore new means of \ncommunications other than email, including a new bill insert  in late 2023.  \nAnother suggestion for a future iteration to ensure all qualified customers to participate  is to \nallow customers other than Rate Schedule 7 to participate in the Pilot who have a qualified \ndevice. Currently the tariff limits the Pilot to Schedule 7, however there are residential \ncustomers on Schedule 32 with , for example, a shop or garage who are not able to \nparticipate due to the tariff language  and cannot enroll their battery in Peak Time Rebates \nsince they are not on Schedule 7 , nor Energy Partner since they are residential .

On December 1, 2022, PGE provided \na status update within Docket UM 2166 and provided the Commission an estimate of the cost \nof extending Bates White through the end of March 2023 to allow for continued engagement.  \nAs resource needs become more frequent , opportunities to streamline process are of \nincreasing importance. PGE notes that it may be inefficient to run a new competitive process to \nsolicit an IE while an IE continues to be engaged as selected t hrough a recent competitive \nprocess. As Bates White continues to serve as the active IE  and was selected via a competitive \nsolicitation process less than two years ago, PGE recommends a waiver of the requirement to \nsolicit a new slate of IE candidates as p art of its  2023 RFP  and rather extend  Bates White\u2019s \nservices  as the IE . \nUnder OAR 860-089- 0200, Commission  Staff will recommend an IE to the Commission \nbased in part on consideration of: (a) input received from the electric company and interested \nnon-bidding parties, (b) review of the degree to which the IE is independent, (c)  degree to which \nthe costs are reasonable, (d) the experience and competence of the IE, and (e) the public interest. The Commission selected Bates White to serve as IE for PGE\u2019s 2021 RFP in Order No. 21-235 on July 15, 2021. As part of that process, Staff conducted an independent review of  the IE bids \nand recommended that the Commission approve Bates White.\n10 In making that \n \n9 UM 2166, PGE\u2019s Application for Approval of Independent Evaluator for 2021 All -Source RFP, filed May 5, 2021, \navailable at: https://edocs.puc.state.or.us/efdocs/HAH/um2166hah15141.pdf  . \n10 Order No. 21- 235, Appendix A at 5.

During that process, Bates White was one of the top three scorers and had experience that \nset it apart from the other top scoring bidders which included prior IE experience, familiarity \nwith the unique Pacific Northwest, extensive knowledge of renewables and energy storage, \nunderstanding of the competitive bidding rules, and the  ability to assess fairness of scoring and \nthe unique risks and advantages of various ownership structures.11 These strengths are still \nrelevant today to the upcoming 2023 RFP and therefore, PGE recommends that Bates Whites \nserve as IE for the 2023 RFP. For this reason, good cause exists to waive OAR 860- 089-0200( 1) \nand (2).  \nSimilarly, regulatory review of PGE\u2019s 2021 RFP occurred within Docket UM 2166 less \nthan two years ago, including a robust regulatory proces s around scoring and modeling \nmethodology\u2014culminating with Order No. 21- 320\u2014and additional regulatory review of \nscoring and modeling as part of the review of the draft RFP , which was approved through Order \nNo. 21- 460.

PGE met this requir ement and procured 11 MWh of energy storage \n(Port Westward 2 and a Microgrid site Beaverton Public Safety Center) as of December 31, 2019. \n2023 Annual Energy Storage Update \nCamino del Sol Mid-Feeder Energy St orage System (formally Baldock) \nThis project was planned to develop and build a 2 MW, two-hour energy st orage system adjacent \nto PGE\u2019s Camino del Sol Solar facility and will be interconnected to th e Canby-Butteville feeder. \nThis project remains on hol d due to estimated costs th at still exceed the stipul ated cost cap for this \nproject with no clear path to comple te this project within the cost r ecovery limits in the stipulation. \nDue to these circumstances, PGE is not moving fo rward with the project at this time, but will  PGE UM 1856 2023 Annual Energy Storage Update \nPage | 2 \nreview again in the future if cost drivers suffici ently change to allow the project to be completed \nwithin the cost cap1. \nNote that the project name was changed, though it is the same location and faci lities. The adjacent \nsolar array had been named after th e Baldock freeway and rest area that it was geogr aphically near, \nbut when the Oregon Department of Transpor tation renamed the rest  area in late 2022 PGE \nfollowed suit. The name of the solar facility and by extension the battery project were renamed to \nCamino del Sol. \nCoffee Creek Substation Energy Storage System \nThis project will develop and build a 17 MW, two-hour energy storage system sited and \ninterconnected at PGE\u2019s Coffee Creek Substation. \nPGE selected FlexGen as the En gineering, Procurement,  and Construction (E PC) Contractor for \nequipment supply and constructi on of the project in 2022. Battery  module fabrication started \nshortly after contract award with factory acc eptance testing of the modules completed in \nSeptember 2023. Civil and structural  design has been completed wi th electrical design nearing \ncompletion. Civil construction is expected to star t mid-October. Site cons truction will carry into \nQ1 2024 with energization expected in Q2 and w ith testing and commissi oning completion in Q3 \n2024. \nMicrogrid Projects (Beaverton Public Saf ety Center and Anderson Readiness Center) \nOverview \nThe Microgrid Pilot Project completed its first mic rogrid at the Beaverton Public Safety Center \n(BPSC), commissioned in September of 2020. The second microgrid at the Oregon Military Department\u2019s Anderson Readiness Center (ARC)  was commissioned in May 2023. Both microgrid \nsites are designed to supp ort community resiliency. \nPGE and the City of Beaverton signed an agreem ent to deploy the 250 kW, four-hour battery and \nmicrogrid at BPSC in 2019, with  PGE owning and operating the ba ttery. The microgrid is also \npowered by a 300 kW PV solar",

Oregon No. E-19 Canceling Original Sheet No. 13-1 \n  \nSCHEDULE 13 \nSMART GRID TESTBED PILOT \n PURPOSE \n \nThe Smart Grid Testbed Pilot (SGTB) is a first-of-its-kind research project meant to advance Portland General Electric\u2019s (PGE) colle ctive understanding and development of demand \nresponse (DR) to gain insight into how PGE could provide a demand-side resource at scale in lieu of traditional supply-side resources. The second phase (Phase II) of the SGTB seeks to \nexpand upon the research and planning conducted in Phase I, which concluded on December \n31, 2022, to increase PGE\u2019s understanding of how customers perceive and value DR so that PGE may more effectively engage customers in flexible load efforts. All Phase I activities concluded December 31, 2022.   \nTo achieve these goals, PGE is piloting the Test Bed Smart Solar Study (Smart Solar Study), Test \nBed EV Charging Study (EV Charging Study), Flexible Feeder, Multi-Family Bundle, and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) demonstration projects.  \nSmart Solar Study: PGE will leverage customer owned \u201csmart inverters\u201d (those equipped \nwith the IEEE 1547-2018 Standard) to assess the valu e of inverter-based controls to deliver \ndistribution operations value (e.g., Volt/VAR support); address hosting capacity issues; and \nsupport orchestration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) together with distributed solar and storage to minimize grid export. PGE will recruit customers with qualifying equipment by offering an upfront incentive in addition to an ongoing monthly incentive for continued enrollment throughout the project duration (January 2023 \u2013 December 2024). \n \nEV Charging Study: PGE will communicate with qualifying customer-owned electric vehicles \n(EV) to control the time of EV charging, while ensuring that the vehicles meet the operational needs of participants, and will evaluate customer acceptance of charge rate, charge time and Location-based Price Signals. Research in this project area will focus on improving understanding of the technical paths for charge management, costs, performance, and \nlimitations",

The increase in costs is partially offset by reduced costs associated with hydro and gas 1 \nplants generation and a decrease in transmission costs. 2 \nQ. Please provide some detail regarding the NVPC reduction associated with hydro and gas 3 \noperations. 4 \nA. The NVPC reduction associated with PGE\u2019s hydro operations is primarily related to : 1) 5 \nincreased expected  total output from hydro contracts at a reduced price per MWh compared 6 \nto the final 2024 NVPC forecast  which contributes to an increase in forward market sales  and 7 \nbenefits; and 2) a reduction in unmet ancillary capacity needs pursuant to the addition of the 8 \nbattery stora ge systems described in section III.C . The reduction in unmet ancillary capacity 9 \nremoves the need for market transactions  to fill this need , resulting in a decrease to forecast 10 \npower costs.  The power cost reduction more than outweighs the increase associat ed with 11 \nupdating the hydro forecast methodology described in Section III.B. Therefore, while the 12 \nchange in hydro forecast methodology results in a power cost increase, that increase is more 13 \nthan offset by the factors described here.  14 \nThe power cost reducti on associated with gas plant operations is related to an increase in 15 \nexpected gas plant generation that benefits power costs due to an associated reduction in 16 \nmarket purchases or an increase in market sales, depending on how the hourly MONET 17 \neconomic ally dispatches  our portfolio.  18  UE 436 / PGE / 100 \nSchwartz  \u2013 Outama \u2013 Cristea / 26 \nUE 436 \u2013 PGE Direct Testimony  of Schwartz, Outama, Cristea V.Qualifications\nQ.Ms. Schwar tz, please describe your qualifications.  1 \nA.

Since the battery has 2 \nlimited cycles, they are first prioritized to months with the largest difference s between charge 3 \nand discharge prices and supporting ancillary services. If there are cycles remaining after 4 \noptimizing for Winter, Summer, and  Ancillary services; the remaining cycles are used in 5 \ntransition months from highest value to lowest value  until all 365 cycles have been used.  6 \nQ. Please discuss the operational effi ciency  derate you appl ied. 7 \nA. PGE acknowledges that the batteries modeled here have yet to achieve commercial operations 8 \nand the model is currently lacking operational experience as a b asis. Therefore, PGE has 9 \nleveraged CAISO battery fleet operations data to model an operational efficiency factor in the 10 \ninitial AUT filing. These factors are applied on a monthly basis using two years of historical 11 \ndata and calculations performed by an independent market analytics vendor .

PGE models using BESS cycles  to respond to the errors between the hour -ahead forecasts and 2 \n5-minutes actuals (or HAFE ). After cycling to optimize market transactions during the most 3 \nvaluable months, there are  battery dispatch cycles remaining  available for providing ancillary 4 \nservices. PGE\u2019s ancillary services modeling prioritizes hydro resources for meeting ancillary 5 \nservice requirements before BESS. BESSs are then modeled to meet any remaining ancillary 6 \nservices needs in hours when there is unmet reserve requirements . 7 \nQ. What is the net power cost benefit associated with three new BESSs included in the 2025 8 \nNVPC forecast ? 9 \nA. The forecast  power cost benefit  associated with the three BESSs, net of the fee s associated 10 \nwith the Troutdale BESS, is approximately $8.8 million  for 2025. 11 \nD.

PGE UM 1856 2023 Annual Energy Storage Update \nPage | 3 \nARC Construction and Commissioning \nARC houses servers that are critic al to the State of Oregon. Keep ing this high availability site \nrunning during construction and com missioning required careful coor dination to avoid any outages \ngreater than ten minutes. \nThe ARC BESS equipment layout and conduit routing designs went through several iterations. \nThis was partly due to updated requirements from the site owner th at were shared partway through \nthe project. Fortunately this was a Design-Build project which made it adaptable to those changes \nand the site owner has been pl eased with the end results. \nARC microgrid commissioning included dozens of grid -connected and islanded tests to verify the \nmicrogrid's performance and reliab ility. One of the main challenges was integrating the existing \ndiesel generation resources th at are part of PGE's Dispat chable Standby Generation (DSG) \nprogram. The logic for control ha ndover between the microgrid controller and the existing DSG \nProgrammable Logic Controller (PLC) requi red several iterati ons to get right. \nSystem Operation \nThese microgrid systems respond to system fre quency events and are dispatched both for \ncontingency reserve and demand response. System  frequency is monitored at a central location \nnear Sherwood and if a deviation is detected the site controller immediately dispatches the battery \nat full output for three minutes before ramping down and slowly r echarging. Contingency reserves \nare centrally dispatched when needed by the Bala ncing Area Authority Op erators. These systems \nhave automatically responded to 51 frequency events  and been dispatched for contingency reserves \n48 times since September 2022.    Table 1 below shows the number of contingency re serve and frequency res ponse dispatches of \nboth the BPSC and ARC microgrid batteries over th e last 12 months.

The most significant is the idea that \nthe monthly payments and pilot incentives are not intended to provide a financial payback for \nthe cost of the battery storage but  are to encourage customers to participate in the Pilot and \noptimize their device \u2019s impact once they have made the investment decision. The customer \nconversation was also foreshadowing that the Smart Grid Testbed rebates were not high \nenough to induce action to purchase a battery if a customer was not already planning on \ndoing so, which is a key reason why the Pilot was redesigned in 2023.  \n \nUM 1856 PGE 2023 Annual Energy Storage Update \nAttach A Residential Smart Battery Pilot Assessment 2023 \nPage 39\n39I like this mailer because it is to the point. gives me a website to \nvisit and lets me know that there is a qualifier for the number of \nparticipants. \nI appreciate the emphasis on clean energy and that is a positive \nstep PGE is taking. \n\"supporting your community\" is more specific than a \"clean energy \nfuture\" another option could be \"supporting your community and \nprotecting the environment\" \nI think people are sophisticated enough to be potentially turned \noff by the typical sales speech.
