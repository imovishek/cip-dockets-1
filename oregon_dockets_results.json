The second phase (Phase II) of the SGTB seeks to \nexpand upon the research and planning conducted in Phase I, which concluded on December \n31, 2022, to increase PGE\u2019s understanding of how customers perceive and value DR so that PGE may more effectively engage customers in flexible load efforts. All Phase I activities concluded December 31, 2022.   \nTo achieve these goals, PGE is piloting both the Test Bed Smart Solar Study (Smart Solar Study) , \nand Test Bed EV Charging Study (EV Charging Study) , Flexible Feeder, and Multi-Family Bundle  \ndemonstration projects. \n \nSmart Solar Study: PGE will leverage custom er owned \u201csmart inverters\u201d (those equipped \nwith the IEEE 1547-2018 Standard) to assess the value of inverter-based controls to \ndeliver distribution operations value (e.g., Volt/VAR support); address hosting capacity \nissues; and support orchestration of Distributed Energy Resources (DER s) together with \ndistributed solar and storage to minimize grid export. PGE will recruit customers with \nqualifying equipment by offering an upfront incentive in addition to an ongoing monthly incentive for continued enrollment throughout the project duration (January 2023 \u2013 \nDecember 2024). \n EV Charging Study: PGE will communicate with qualifying customer-owned electric \nvehicles (EV) to control the time of EV charging, while ensuring that the vehicles meet the operational needs of participants, and will evaluate customer acceptance of charge rate, charge time and Location-based Price Signals. Research in this project area will focus on \nimproving understanding of the technical paths for charge management, costs, \nperformance, and limitations.

The pilot deferrals and dockets included for this filing are: \n\uf0b7 UM 2078 Residential Battery Storage \n\uf0b7 UM 2113 Non-Residential Energy Storage Pilots \n \nThe following costs are included in the Schedule 138 prices for 2024: \n\uf0b7 The Residential Battery Storage Pilot 2024 budgeted O&M costs of \napproximately $0.7 million. Ho wever, the projected bal ance at the end of 2023 is \nestimated to be a credit of about $0. 3 million due to lower than expected \nparticipation in the pilot during the pandemic era. PGE proposes to set the Schedule 138 collection rate to 0% in 2024 in order to reduc e the balance. PGE \nwill reassess the recovery rate in its f iling next year and reintroduce the charge. \n In 2023 the deferred revenue requirement of appr oximately $1.3 milli on, accrued prior to \nMay 9, 2022,\n1 associated with capital costs incurred for the Beaverton Public Safety \nCenter (BPSC) energy storage microgrid and the Port Westward 2 (PW2) energy storage project were collected via Schedul e 138. Based on current collections, PGE \nestimates a balance of $18K in the balancing account at the end of December 2023. \nPGE will move any final balance in January to  the residual account for collection or \nrefund via Schedule 105 R egulatory Adjustments. \n \n \n1PGE\u2019s 2022 general rate case (Docket No. UE 394) effective date.

INTRODUCTION \nIn accordance with the competitive bidding rules adopted by the Public Utility \nCommission of Oregon (Commission or OPUC), Portland General Electric Company (PGE) \nprovides notice of the commencement of the process for a 2023 All -Source Request for Proposals  \n(RFP) and requests that the Commission open a docket for this purpose. PGE\u2019s development of its 2023 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP)  and Clean Energy Plan (CEP) , and commitment to \ncontinual  progress toward decarbonization under House Bill HB 2021 (HB 2021) point to a likely \n2026 capacity need,\n1 and an anticipated  need for additional carbon- free energy resources  as we \nwork toward the 2030 decarbonization target . Therefore, a 2023 RFP is nece ssary so  that \nresources can be in -service in time to meet this upcoming need  and to demonstrate continual  \nprogress toward the decarbonization targets specified in HB 2021. The competitive bidding rules \nare triggered due to the size and duration of the resources to be sought in this RFP. \nAs part of this filing, in accordance with OAR 860-089-0010(2),  PGE also requests a \npartial waiver of the competitive bidding rules, including a waiver of OAR 860-089-0200(1), \n \n1 See December 16, 2022 meeting materials at Slide 17, available at: \nhttps://assets.ctfassets.net/416ywc1laqm d/7AUDtFKsutaZB5zUWTzbHo/db4f426352329e0fc05d30f50325b2f7/IRP\n_Roundtable_December_22- 11.pdf   UM 2274 \u2013 PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY\u2019S NOTICE AND REQUEST FOR \nPARTIAL WAIVER OF COMPETITIVE BIDDING RULES     Page 2  OAR 860 -089-0200(2), OAR 860 -089-0250(2)(a ) and OAR 860- 089-0250(3)(g) . PGE seeks to \ncontinue working with the IE used for the 2021 RFP, to have the scoring and modeling methodology \nreview occur in parallel with review of the draft RFP, and to have the 2023 RFP review process run \nin parallel with the 2023 IRP and CEP docket.  \nTo streamline the RFP process considering the timing needs discussed below, PGE \nrecommends the following:  \n",

PGE seeks to \ncontinue working with the IE used for the 2021 RFP, to have the scoring and modeling methodology \nreview occur in parallel with review of the draft RFP, and to have the 2023 RFP review process run \nin parallel with the 2023 IRP and CEP docket.  \nTo streamline the RFP process considering the timing needs discussed below, PGE \nrecommends the following:  \n1. PGE conducts  the 2023 RFP in parallel with the Commission\u2019s acknowledgement \nprocess  of PGE\u2019s 2023 IRP (a \u201ctrack two\u201d RFP process).2 PGE\u2019s 2023 IRP and CEP  \ndocket  would run in parallel with the 2023 RFP, which would culminate in \nanticipated Commission decisions regarding acknowledgment of the 2023 IRP and CEP, and 2023 RFP final shortlist in December 2023. While the regulatory review \nof the 2023 IRP and CEP , and the 2023 RFP would run in parallel, PGE anticipates \nthat the ultimate procurement volume will align with the  2023 IRP and CEP action \nplan once PGE\u2019s resource plans are acknowledged . However, due to the need for \nconcurrent processes , the estimated  need outlined in the draft RFP for approval by \nthe Commission would align with the most recently filed  IRP. Additiona lly, as \ndiscussed below, the scoring and modeling methodology would not be discussed in \nthe 2023 IRP, but instead would be reviewed as part of the draft RFP approval \nprocess contemplated under OAR 860- 089-0250 (2)(a) and below.   \n \n2 Track two refer s to OAR 860 -089-0250(2)(a), which states  \u201c[u]nless the electric company intends to use an RFP \nwhose design, scoring methodology, and associated modeling process were included as part of the Commission-\nacknowledged IRP, the electric company must, prior to preparing a draft RFP, develop and file for approval in the \nelectric company's IE selection docket, a proposal for scoring and any associated model ing.\u201d   UM 2274 \u2013 PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY\u2019S NOTICE AND REQUEST FOR \nPARTIAL WAIVER OF COMPETITIVE BIDDING RULES     Page 3  2. The selection of the independent evaluator ( IE) (OAR 860 -089-0200(1)) and the \nreview of the scoring and modeling methodology (OAR 860- 089-0250( 2)(a)) should \nbe streamlined through partial waiver of these regulations. PGE respectfully requests \nthat the Commission allow an exten sion of Bates White , who is already serving as \nan IE as UM 2166 commercial negotiations , continue  and serve as the IE for this \nupcoming solicitation . Additionally, PGE recommends that the Commission allow \nthe review of the scoring and modeling methodology to occur simultaneously with \nthe review of the draft RFP.  Parties would have an opportunity to review and provide \nfeedback on the draft scoring and modeling methodology as part of the review of the draft RFP.  \n3. Development of procedural timelines that balanc e the need for robust regulatory \nreview and feedback with the significant timing constraints between now and 2030. PGE looks forward to working with Staff and stakeholders to determine a procedural \nschedule that balances these considerations.  \nIn accordance with OAR  860- 089-0010(2)(a), PGE is serving this request on parties to \nthe most recent general rate case (UE 394) , RFP filing  (UM 2166) , and IRP docket  (LC 73) .  \nII.

PGE forecasts  a significant near -term capacity need , and continual progress toward \nHouse Bill 2021\u2019s decarbonization targets  indicates that addit ional procurement \nactions are needed.  \nPGE is forecasting a significant capacity need beginning in 2026, as well as the need for \nadditional procurement of non- emitting energy resources to make continual progress toward \nHouse Bill 2021\u2019s decarbonization targets.

The track two process recommended  in this filing for the  2023 RFP would allow for \nregulatory review of both the scoring and methodology and the draft RFP simultaneously . \nAdditionally, review of the draft RFP would occur  simultaneously with review of the 2023 IRP \nand CEP, which would culminate with acknowledgment of the final shortlist by December  2023. \nAs the timing of both the 2023 RFP and the 2023 IRP  and CEP would run through the fourth \nquarter of 2023, it is PGE\u2019s in tent that the volume to be acquired through the 2023 RFP would \nalign with the  volume of resources specified in the  2023 IRP action plan  that is ultimately \nconsidered for Commission acknowledgment . \nThe resource need and timing associated with the 2023 IRP and 2023 RFP represents \ngood cause to use a streamlined  track two process as contemplated in OAR 860 -089-0250(2) (a) \nand reviewing the 2023 RFP simultaneously with the 2023 IRP and CEP .

Box 1088 Salem, OR  97308-1088  RE: Advice No. 23-17, Schedule 13 Sm art Grid Testbed Pilot Update \n Portland General Electric Company (PGE) s ubmits this filing pursu ant to Oregon Revised \nStatutes 757.205 and 757. 210, and Oregon Administrative Rule 860-022-0025, for filing \nproposed tariff sheets associated with Tariff P. U.C. No. 18, with a requested effective \ndate of November 17, 2023 : \n  Fourth Revision of Sheet No. 13-1  Fourth Revision of Sheet No. 13-2  Second Revision of Sheet No. 13-3  Third Revision of Sheet No. 13-4\n1 \n Original Sheet No. 13-5  \nPGE seeks to revise Schedule 13 Smart Grid Testbed (SGTB) Pilot to add the next two \nPhase II activities: the Flexible Feeder St udy, and the Multi-family New Construction \nStudy.  The Flexible Feeder demonstration seeks to  explore the potential benefit of a \nconcentrated number of connected Distribut ed Energy Resources (DERs) providing \nsupport to the grid. PGE will study this benefit  by enrolling customers in the project area \nin existing energy efficiency and demand respons e offers (i.e., Schedu les 5, 8, 14, and \n25) as a precondition to participation in the st udy. Due to the complexity of the incentive \noffers, PGE is proposing publis hing all incentive and eligibi lity details on the program \nwebsite. A list of incentive offerings re viewed by the SGTB De mand Response Review \nCommittee (DRRC) in September 2023 is included in this filing as Attachment A. PGE will \nreview any subsequent changes to incentive o ffers with the DRRC and maintain historic \nrecords of incentive offer availability.         \n1. PGE withdrew the Second Revision of Sheet No. 13-4 due to pagination in Advice No. 22-24. \n \n Portland General Electric \n121 SW Salmon Street\u2022 Portland, OR 97204 \nportlandgeneral .com  PGE Advice No. 23-17  \nPage 2 \n \n The Schedule 13 update also in cludes provisions to implement the Multifamily New \nConstruction Study consistent with the Commission\u2019s approval of the implementation plan \nin Order 23-258, which will prov ide equipment incentives to  participating multi-family \nproperties to support the inst allation of flexible load en abled heat pump water heating \nequipment. \n This filing does not include tariff updates for ei ther of the two other studies approved by \nthe Commission in Order No. 23-258, the Singl e Family New Construction demonstration \nor the Multi-family Retrofit study. The development of the Si ngle Family New Construction \ndemonstration will benefit from  additional outreach and collabora tion with potential builder \nparticipants to better define the market need and to inform the most effective incentive \nstructure. Further refi nement over the remainder  of the year will info rm future contracting \nand/or tariff updates for the impl ementation phase. The extension of a tariff filing for the \nSingle Family New Construc tion demonstration does not impac t any of the other testbed \nstudies nor any existing PGE programs.  For the Multi-family Retrofit  study, PGE has determined the project plan and incentive \nstructure as proposed does not  align well with t he intended focus of the SGTB since \nadoption of flex load-ready equipment is no w occurring naturally through building code \nrequirements. Equipment incentives are not seen as primary driver s for this adoption. \nTherefore, PGE hopes to ali gn SGTB efforts in support of  existing ongoing programmatic \nupdates, specifically the relaunc h of the Multi-family Water Heater Pilot (Schedule 4). \nPGE intends to leverage the technical work mo ving forward in the SGTB Multi-family New \nConstruction studies to inform the updates being made to the Multi-family Water Heater \nPilot and intends to develop and share pr oposed next steps with the DRRC for how the \nMulti-family Retrofit budget can best support these efforts. \n The Single Family New Construction and Mu lti-family Retrofit  studies, along with \nadditional demonstration projects, will be incorpor ated in a future tariff update as SGTB \nPhase II continues.

NVPC include wholesale (physical and financi al) power purchases and sales ( purchased 13 \npower and sales for  resale ), fuel costs, and other costs that generally change as power output 14 \nchanges. PGE records its NVPC to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) accounts 15 \n447, 501, 547, 555, and 565. As in the 2024 NVPC forecast , we include certain variable 16 \nchemical costs, lubricating oil costs, and forecasted  federal production tax credits  (PTCs) . We 17 \nexclude some variable power costs, such as certain variable operation and maintenance costs 18 \n(O&M), because they are already included elsewhere in PGE\u2019s accounting.

UM 2274 \u2013 PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY\u2019S NOTICE AND REQUEST FOR \nPARTIAL WAIVER OF COMPETITIVE BIDDING RULES     Page 7 C. Partial waivers of OAR 860-089-0200(1) , OAR 860 -089-0200(2), and OAR 860-089-\n0250(2) (a) will streamline process while retaining robust regulatory review.   \nPGE issued a request for proposal to seek IE candidates as part of its  2021 RFP, which \noccurred approximately 18 months ago.9 The successful candidate\u2014Bates White\u2014oversaw the \n2021 RFP process and  continues to report to the Commission as PGE continues to progress on \nits commercial negotiations associated with the 2021 RFP. On December 1, 2022, PGE provided \na status update within Docket UM 2166 and provided the Commission an estimate of the cost \nof extending Bates White through the end of March 2023 to allow for continued engagement.  \nAs resource needs become more frequent , opportunities to streamline process are of \nincreasing importance. PGE notes that it may be inefficient to run a new competitive process to \nsolicit an IE while an IE continues to be engaged as selected t hrough a recent competitive \nprocess. As Bates White continues to serve as the active IE  and was selected via a competitive \nsolicitation process less than two years ago, PGE recommends a waiver of the requirement to \nsolicit a new slate of IE candidates as p art of its  2023 RFP  and rather extend  Bates White\u2019s \nservices  as the IE . \nUnder OAR 860-089- 0200, Commission  Staff will recommend an IE to the Commission \nbased in part on consideration of: (a) input received from the electric company and interested \nnon-bidding parties, (b) review of the degree to which the IE is independent, (c)  degree to which \nthe costs are reasonable, (d) the experience and competence of the IE, and (e) the public interest. The Commission selected Bates White to serve as IE for PGE\u2019s 2021 RFP in Order No. 21-235 on July 15, 2021. As part of that process, Staff conducted an independent review of  the IE bids \nand recommended that the Commission approve Bates White.\n10 In making that \n \n9 UM 2166, PGE\u2019s Application for Approval of Independent Evaluator for 2021 All -Source RFP, filed May 5, 2021, \navailable at: https://edocs.puc.state.or.us/efdocs/HAH/um2166hah15141.pdf  . \n10 Order No. 21- 235, Appendix A at 5.   UM 2274 \u2013 PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY\u2019S NOTICE AND REQUEST FOR \nPARTIAL WAIVER OF COMPETITIVE BIDDING RULES     Page 8  recommendation, Staff outlined its consideration of the elements outlined in OAR 860- 089-\n0200. During that process, Bates White was one of the top three scorers and had experience that \nset it apart from the other top scoring bidders which included prior IE experience, familiarity \nwith the unique Pacific Northwest, extensive knowledge of renewables and energy storage, \nunderstanding of the competitive bidding rules, and the  ability to assess fairness of scoring and \nthe unique risks and advantages of various ownership structures.11 These strengths are still \nrelevant today to the upcoming 2023 RFP and therefore, PGE recommends that Bates Whites \nserve as IE for the 2023 RFP. For this reason, good cause exists to waive OAR 860- 089-0200( 1) \nand (2).  \nSimilarly, regulatory review of PGE\u2019s 2021 RFP occurred within Docket UM 2166 less \nthan two years ago, including a robust regulatory proces s around scoring and modeling \nmethodology\u2014culminating with Order No. 21- 320\u2014and additional regulatory review of \nscoring and modeling as part of the review of the draft RFP , which was approved through Order \nNo. 21- 460. As the 2023 RFP immediately follows th e 2021 RFP, PGE will likely use the \nscoring methodology from  UM 2166 as a bas is for developing the ",

The second phase (Phase II) of the SGTB seeks to \nexpand upon the research and planning conducted in Phase I, which concluded on December \n31, 2022, to increase PGE\u2019s understanding of how customers perceive and value DR so that PGE may more effectively engage customers in flexible load efforts. All Phase I activities concluded December 31, 2022.   \nTo achieve these goals, PGE is piloting the Test Bed Smart Solar Study (Smart Solar Study), Test \nBed EV Charging Study (EV Charging Study), Flexible Feeder, Multi-Family Bundle, and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) demonstration projects.  \nSmart Solar Study: PGE will leverage customer owned \u201csmart inverters\u201d (those equipped \nwith the IEEE 1547-2018 Standard) to assess the valu e of inverter-based controls to deliver \ndistribution operations value (e.g., Volt/VAR support); address hosting capacity issues; and \nsupport orchestration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) together with distributed solar and storage to minimize grid export. PGE will recruit customers with qualifying equipment by offering an upfront incentive in addition to an ongoing monthly incentive for continued enrollment throughout the project duration (January 2023 \u2013 December 2024). \n \nEV Charging Study: PGE will communicate with qualifying customer-owned electric vehicles \n(EV) to control the time of EV charging, while ensuring that the vehicles meet the operational needs of participants, and will evaluate customer acceptance of charge rate, charge time and Location-based Price Signals. Research in this project area will focus on improving understanding of the technical paths for charge management, costs, performance, and \nlimitations",

The increase in costs is partially offset by reduced costs associated with hydro and gas 1 \nplants generation and a decrease in transmission costs. 2 \nQ. Please provide some detail regarding the NVPC reduction associated with hydro and gas 3 \noperations. 4 \nA. The NVPC reduction associated with PGE\u2019s hydro operations is primarily related to : 1) 5 \nincreased expected  total output from hydro contracts at a reduced price per MWh compared 6 \nto the final 2024 NVPC forecast  which contributes to an increase in forward market sales  and 7 \nbenefits; and 2) a reduction in unmet ancillary capacity needs pursuant to the addition of the 8 \nbattery stora ge systems described in section III.C . The reduction in unmet ancillary capacity 9 \nremoves the need for market transactions  to fill this need , resulting in a decrease to forecast 10 \npower costs.  The power cost reduction more than outweighs the increase associat ed with 11 \nupdating the hydro forecast methodology described in Section III.B. Therefore, while the 12 \nchange in hydro forecast methodology results in a power cost increase, that increase is more 13 \nthan offset by the factors described here.  14 \nThe power cost reducti on associated with gas plant operations is related to an increase in 15 \nexpected gas plant generation that benefits power costs due to an associated reduction in 16 \nmarket purchases or an increase in market sales, depending on how the hourly MONET 17 \neconomic ally dispatches  our portfolio.  18  UE 436 / PGE / 100 \nSchwartz  \u2013 Outama \u2013 Cristea / 26 \nUE 436 \u2013 PGE Direct Testimony  of Schwartz, Outama, Cristea V.Qualifications\nQ.Ms. Schwar tz, please describe your qualifications.  1 \nA.

PGE models using BESS cycles  to respond to the errors between the hour -ahead forecasts and 2 \n5-minutes actuals (or HAFE ). After cycling to optimize market transactions during the most 3 \nvaluable months, there are  battery dispatch cycles remaining  available for providing ancillary 4 \nservices. PGE\u2019s ancillary services modeling prioritizes hydro resources for meeting ancillary 5 \nservice requirements before BESS. BESSs are then modeled to meet any remaining ancillary 6 \nservices needs in hours when there is unmet reserve requirements . 7 \nQ. What is the net power cost benefit associated with three new BESSs included in the 2025 8 \nNVPC forecast ? 9 \nA.
